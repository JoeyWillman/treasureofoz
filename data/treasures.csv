naturepreserve,Forest Beach Migratory Preserve,Port Washington,"<p>
  The Squires’ Property is a unique and important project. The 116 acre site was previously used as a golf course. However, the site boasts significant ecological value and restoration potential due to its size and proximity to Lake Michigan. The property is located on the Lake Michigan shoreline with the majority of the golf course situated approximately 600 feet inland. It is one of the largest tracts of open land remaining in Ozaukee County along Lake Michigan. The property features a 5-acre hardwood forest with ephemeral (seasonal) ponds, open grassland and prairie, a partially wooded ravine and five constructed wetland ponds.
</p>

<p>
  The property’s location and attributes lends itself to supporting migratory birds along the Lake Michigan Flyway. Immediately upon acquisition OWLT will begin stewardship activities including invasive and exotic plant control. Key restoration projects and restoration preparation activities will be conducted in the Spring of 2009. Wetland restoration and activities will begin in the summer of 2009 and continue through the fall.

park,Coal Dock Park,Port Washington,"<p>The Ozaukee County clay bluffs south of the coal docks are a unique geological feature. Water action from Lake Michigan erodes the glacial deposits along the shoreline to create spectacular views of Lake Michigan from steep-sided bluffs that are often over 100 feet above the lake. In places, steep ravines lined with cedar trees are cut by small streams through the bluffs, providing wildlife habitat and a quiet respite from the crashing waves.</p><p>The eroded face of the bluffs provides a fascinating glimpse of the recent glacial activity that not only deposited the soil but carved Lake Michigan itself. Evident are the glacial tills, the mass of rocks and ground material picked up by the glaciers and deposited as they melted. Between the tills are sandy outwash layers deposited by meltwater streams in front of the receding glaciers. Together these deposits paint a picture of the glacier’s activity.</p><p>The glacial materials in the bluffs and on the beaches provide wildlife habitat and hours of interest for visitors walking the beach. Bank swallows and kingfishers nest in cavities they excavate in the soft sandy outwash deposits. Wetlands form on steep slopes from the springs and seeps along the bluffs. Rocks of all types and colors, carried and smoothed by the glacier, cover portions of the beach and provide hours of pleasant distraction. Walk along the beach, with the timeless sound of waves and gulls, Lake Michigan stretching endlessly east and the glacial bluffs hiding most traces of civilization, and it’s easy to believe you are walking in a world almost untouched by humans.</p>","Hiking, Bird Watching",Parking (limited street) Trail System,,43.38549821,-87.86702023,#VALUE!,#VALUE!

Once part of a large glacial lake, the bog is a relict community - a southern example of the type more commonly found in northern Wisconsin. There are six lakes remaining within the bog, all with varying sizes and depths. The 245-acre Mud Lake is the largest, followed by the 34-acre Long Lake. Surrounding the lakes are areas of emergent aquatic vegetation while just outside this zone is a successional shrub-carr area. Most unusual is a string or ""patterned"" bog, unique here because it lies far south of its usual range in North America. It is composed of ridges of stunted cedar and tamarack that lie in an open flat sedge mat. The meadow vegetation consists of narrow-leaved sedges, pitcher plant, bogbean, water horsetail, arrow-grass, orchids, and the insectivorous sundew and bladderwort. A conifer-swamp hardwood forest is adjacent to the bog. There is a very diverse flora and fauna; many that are more common in northern boreal forests and that are at their southern range limit here.</p><p>The Cedarburg Bog was designated a State Natural Area in 1952: it was the second property in the state added to this program.

wpa,Armin O. Schwengel Waterfowl Production Area,Belgium,"<p>The <strong>Armin O. Schwengel Waterfowl Production Area (WPA)</strong> is a 278-acre preserve located at the junction of Six Mile and Jay Roads in Ozaukee County. Considered the county’s premier grassland habitat, this site provides refuge for bobolinks, meadowlarks, shorebirds, marsh birds, and ducks throughout the year. Short-eared owls are also frequent winter visitors.</p> <p>The property is named after <strong>Armin O. Schwengel</strong>, a local conservationist who dedicated more than 55 years to wetland and wildlife restoration across southeastern Wisconsin. A graduate of Port Washington High School in 1935, Schwengel attended both the University of Wisconsin–Madison and Michigan State University, studying under the renowned ecologist Aldo Leopold, often called the father of modern conservation.</p> <p>Over his career, Schwengel helped shape the landscape of Wisconsin’s conservation lands. Hired by the Wisconsin Conservation Corps in 1941 and later serving as game manager for southeastern Wisconsin, he persuaded farmers to sell thousands of acres of wetlands and floodplain forests, leading to the creation of the <em>Theresa</em>, <em>Allenton</em>, and <em>Jackson State Wildlife Areas</em>. He also assisted the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service in acquiring more than 500 acres of farmland in Ozaukee County and worked with private landowners to restore more than 600 acres of drained wetlands.</p> <p>Schwengel retired from the Wisconsin DNR in 1982 after 41 years of service but returned in 1989 to continue wetland restoration work in Ozaukee County. When asked about his lifelong dedication, he remarked, “I wanted to leave some of this here before I leave, you know. It’s all here for future generations.”</p> <p>His remarkable legacy—over <strong>10,400 acres</strong> of wetlands and grass-covered hills now thriving across southeastern Wisconsin—stands as a testament to his vision and persistence. To honor his achievements, the <strong>U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service</strong> named this 280-acre wildlife area after him, ensuring his name endures alongside the habitats he worked tirelessly to protect.</p>","Hiking, Bird Watching",Parking,,43.51966133,-87.88177832,#VALUE!,#VALUE!
